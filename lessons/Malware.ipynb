    "### Malware classification\n",
    "Uusually simply defined as software that does something bad, from the perspective of the system owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "classified according to:\n",
    "    \n",
    "i) attack vector used(Way of execution and spread on host or network)-  Tojan, Virus, Worms\n",
    "\n",
    "    Virus and worms - \n",
    "        these represent some of the first types of malware and spread without any authorization from the user by being concealed within the executable code of another process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Trojan - \n",
    "\n",
    "        Seeks no consent and acts secretely\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs)/Potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) - \n",
    "        software installed alongside a package selected by the user or perhaps bundled with a new computer system. \n",
    "        Unlike trojan nor considered as malicious\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) payload delivered by malware - \n",
    "    spyware, rootkit, remote access Trojan (RAT), and ransomwarew\n",
    "\n",
    "Viruses\n",
    "    Non-resident/file infector - \n",
    "        indide a file and runs with the host process\n",
    "    \n",
    "    memtory resident - \n",
    "        when executed creates new process in memory and remains even after host process terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Boot - \n",
    "        written to the disk boot sector or the partition table of a fixed disk or USB media, and executes as a memory resident process when the OS starts or the media is attached to the computer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Script and macro viruses - \n",
    "        malware uses the programming features available in local scripting engines for the OS and/or browser\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spyware and Keyloggers\n",
    "The first viruses and worms focused on the destructive potential of being able to replicate.\n",
    "Monitoring performances:\n",
    "* Tracking cookies\n",
    "* Adware\n",
    "* Spyware\n",
    "* Keylogger\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backdoors and Remote Access Trojans\n",
    "circumvents the usual authentication method and gives the remote user administrative control can be referred to as a backdoor. A remote access trojan (RAT) is backdoor malware that mimics the functionality of legitimate remote control programs, but is designed specifically to operate covertly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rootkits\n",
    "it may be able to execute without requiring any authorization using SYSTEM privileges. Alternatively, the malware may be able to use an exploit to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level after installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ransomware , Crypto-malware, Logic Bombs\n",
    "type of malware that tries to extort money from the victim. One class of ransomware will display threatening messages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### crypto malware \n",
    "* attempts to encrypt data files on any fixed, removable, and network drives. If the attack is successful, the user will be unable to access the files without obtaining the private encryption key, which is held by the attacker. \n",
    "*  hijacks the resources of the host to perform cryptocurrency mining.using a performance monitor This is referred to as crypto-mining or cryptojacking. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Malware indicators\n",
    "* Antivirus notifications - Endpoint protection platforms(EPPs)\n",
    "    Many suites also integrate with user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) and use AI-backed analysis to detect threat actor behavior that has bypassed malware signature matching.\n",
    "* Resource Consumption - using a performance monitor\n",
    "* File system - Even if the malware code is not saved to disk, the malware is still likely to interact with the file system and registry, revealing its presence by behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Malware Indicators\n",
    "#### Sandbox Execution\n",
    "If it is not detected by endpoint protection, you may want to analyze the suspect code in a sandboxed environment.\n",
    "A sandbox is a system configured to be completely isolated from its host so that the malware cannot \"break out.\" \n",
    "he sandbox will be designed to record file system and registry changes plus network activity. Cuckoo is packaged software that aims to provide a turnkey sandbox solution, though the project is inactive at time of writing [text](github.com/cuckoosandbox/cuckoo).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Analysis\n",
    "This means close analysis of the processes running in system memory on a host. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sysinternals\n",
    "Sysinternals (docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals) is a suite of tools designed to assist with troubleshooting issues with Windows, and many of the tools are suited to investigating security issues.\n",
